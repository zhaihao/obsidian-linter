This Obsidian plugin formats and styles your notes with a focus on configurability and extensibility.
Rules can be toggled and configured in the settings. The main documentation on rules and other things are
located on the [wiki](https://platers.github.io/obsidian-linter/). Below is a quick run down of some reference links to the rules that exist and how to install the Linter.

## Rules

Documentation for all rules can be found on the [wiki](https://platers.github.io/obsidian-linter/). The docs are updated before the plugin is released, so they may not be completely accurate.

Each rule is its own set of logic and is designed to be run independently. This means that enabling certain rules together could cause undesired results. One such case would be using "Paragraph blank lines" with "Two Spaces Between Lines with Content". These two rules have some overlap in what they target to change which results in undesired or unexpected results since together they work differently than if they were run by themselves.
